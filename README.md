Project Description
This project aims to design and build a 3D printed, ESP32-controlled aircraft. The aircraft will be fully programmable and remotely controlled, offering a unique and customizable flying experience.

Features
3D Printed Components: The main body of the aircraft, including the wings, tail, and fuselage, will be 3D printed. This allows for easy customization and repair.
ESP32 Microcontroller: The brain of the aircraft is an ESP32 microcontroller. This powerful and versatile chip is perfect for controlling the various components of the aircraft.
Remote Control: The aircraft will be controllable via a remote control interface, allowing the user to pilot the aircraft from a safe distance.
Programmable: With the ESP32, the aircraft can be programmed to perform a variety of maneuvers and actions. This opens up a world of possibilities for what the aircraft can do.
Goals
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, 3D printed, ESP32-controlled aircraft. This project will demonstrate the capabilities of 3D printing and microcontroller programming in a fun and engaging way.
